# MassImgConv
A small program that converts jpg, jpeg and webp images to png with an option to scale them to a maximum of 512px by 512px (maintaining proportions) for telegram stickers.

############
REQUIREMENTS
############

Windows 10 or newer
NOTE: I only tested it on windows 10and cannot guarantee it works on newer versions.
Side-note for LINUX: You can still use this program on Linux by running "python3 MassImgConv.py" from the console after navigating to the folder you saved it in.

############ INSTALLATION ############

It should be very simple:

1) Download all the files
2) Put them in your preferred folder
3) Navigate to the /dist folder and right click the .exe file
4) Hover over "Send to" and then click "Send to desktop (Create shortcut)" (This will create a desktop shortcut you can use and move to easily access the program)
